          In Hindu tradition, Guru is looked upon as an embodiment of God himself. It is through Guru’s grace and guidance that one reaches the highest state of wisdom and bliss, and Guru Seva (service) is regarded as the highest and noblest of all the actions in this Universe.
        <p align="left">Clarity is seeing the holy body of Guru, saying the holy name of Guru, listening to the holy words of Guru, and contemplating the holy form of Guru. Sadguru Shirdi Saibaba is the ultimate master and Guru. Saibaba continues to protect, guide, and bless His devotees even after His Samadhi. The central message of the life and teachings of Saibaba is: Love, which is synonymous with universal brotherhood, transcending all manmade barriers of segregation; Unassailable faith in the existence and mercy of God; If you take one step towards Me, I will take ten steps towards you. Sai never sends anyone empty handed from His doorstep, a promise He made at the time of His Samadhi which he continues to fulfil. Baba is ever merciful to shower His devotees with material benefits or spiritual guidance according to their desires. Arizona did not have a temple for Shirdi Saibaba, where devotees could gather to offer prayers. They either prayed alone or formed small groups to perform Aarathis to Him; a few ardent devotees even regularly flew to other states to pay their homage to Him. With blessings from Sadhguru Shirdi Saibaba, and under the guidance of Shri Saipaadha Meiyadimmai, an ardent devotee and disciple of Shri Shirdi Saibaba, a few devoted families started to get together regularly and perform Aarathi every Thursday evening in their homes.
        <p align="left">Other devotees in the area soon heard of this and started joining in large numbers, making it a challenge to accommodate the worship in a house setting. Such is Baba’s love drawing everyone in, always assuring of His protection and blessings… and He showed a solution! Under the direction of Swami <a href="http://www.saipadam.org" target="_blank">Shri Saipaadha Meiyadimmai </a> , on March 19th, 2011, a new place of worship was started in the Phoenix area, which could hold a bigger gathering. We are blessed to have this beautiful temple as a nodal center for all Sai devotees to offer prayers, serve Him, and receive His blessings. Thanks to the tremendous patronage of His devotees, we’ve continued to grow and are in the midst of building a bigger, dedicated temple and prayer sanctuary.
